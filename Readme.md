# Kickstarter Crowd Funding Data Visualization 

## Overview of Project: 

### This analysis is to discover trends in [Kickstarter crowd funding projects](https://github.com/GNovakGit/Kickstarter-Challenge-1/blob/main/Kickstarter_challenge_1.xlsx) from years 2009 to 2017. This comparison of kickstarter campaigns will be based on [Graph1](https://github.com/GNovakGit/Kickstarter-Challenge-1/blob/main/Theatre_Outcomes_vs_Launch_Graph.png) and [Graph2](https://github.com/GNovakGit/Kickstarter-Challenge-1/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png). 

### The first [Pivot table](https://github.com/GNovakGit/Kickstarter-Challenge-1/blob/main/Theatre_Outcomes_vs_Launch_Graph.png) in line graph form will present the number of successful, failed, or canceled theatre campaigns based on which month they were launched. The second [Pivot table](https://github.com/GNovakGit/Kickstarter-Challenge-1/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) in line graph form will show comparisons between what percentage of plays were successful, failed, or canceled, based on ability to obtain their funding goals.

## Challenges:

### Remembering to sort by the subcategory "plays" and parent category "theaters" was critical to remove unwanted outliers. Additionally sorting the launch date by month for each campaign further increases accuracy within the dataset. 

## Analysis/Results

### When looking at the [outcomes based on goals](https://github.com/GNovakGit/Kickstarter-Challenge-1/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) pivot table, it is evident that 54%-76% of successful play campaigns have a funding goal range of roughly $1,000 to $10,000 and $35,000 to $40,000. 80% of plays failed at a goal of $25,000 to $29,999. Noteably, 100% of plays failed with a funding goal of $45,000 to $49,999 and 83% of plays failed with goals greater than or equal to $50,000. The most succesful campaigns had goals of less than or equal to $1,000 up to $4,999.

### The outcomes based on launch date [Line Chart](https://github.com/GNovakGit/Kickstarter-Challenge-1/blob/main/Theatre_Outcomes_vs_Launch_Graph.png) indicates the most sucessful theatre campaigns were launched in May, June, and July. Failed campaigns are noticeable in October, May, and July. December indicates a month when the number of successful and failed theatre campaigns were roughly the same. 

#### Limitations of the data include Year. If we include data from other years it would expand the results. 

#### We could include other charts relating to average donations vs. outcomes, or average donation vs. date creted.
